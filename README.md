# RSCDLCEnabler-2020Edition

Based on Lovrom8 and Kokos work (aswell as original CDLC dll creator), I've just slimmed out some functions to make a basic version that JUST does the songlist mod and CDLC enabling.
If maingame.csv is modified with entries in 46964-9 - then those will be used, If NOT, the RSMods.ini ill be used.

The RSMods.ini file is the method 99.9999999% of users should be using, maingame.csv mod is only for users that have been using our earlier songlist hack.
