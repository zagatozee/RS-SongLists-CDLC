# RSCDLCEnabler-2020Edition

Based on Lovrom8 and Kokos work (aswell as the original CDLC dll creator), I've just slimmed out some functions to make a basic version that JUST does the songlist mod and CDLC enabling.
If maingame.csv is modified with entries in 46964-9 - then those will be used, If NOT, the RSMods.ini ill be used.

The RSMods.ini file is the method 99.9999999% of users should be using, maingame.csv mod is only for users that have been using our earlier songlist hack.


How to use?

Download the D3DX9_42.dll  file from the "ready to download" folder, this replaces the existing CDLC enabling one in your Rockmsith2014 root folder. CDLC will still work just fine.
Download the RSMods.ini file to the same folder as the .dll file - \Rocksmith2014\

Edit the RSMods.ini file to define your 6 chosen song list names and save.

Run Rockmsith2014 from Steam as usual.
